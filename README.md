# hello-world
This is a simple exercise to get me started while learning GitHub.

I'm a high school social studies teacher, but I majored in something like applied linguistics. I love languages and I used to write html/css websites, so I'm currently self-studying those two plus Javascript to transition to a career in front-end development. I'm glad to be a part of the GitHub community!
